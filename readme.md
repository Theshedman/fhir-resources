# HL7 FHIR Learning Resources

HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) is one of the most anticipated interoperability standards in healthcare today. The standard is currently at release 4 (FHIR R4), with release 5 (FHIR R5) on the near horizon. Around the world, countries are looking at how to solve issues with interoperability. 

Here are some links to free online resources to learning about FHIR.

## Health Informatics: A Current and Historical Perspective 
Background on US healthcare, the key current applications of informatics in healthcare delivery
### Link: 
https://www.edx.org/course/health-informatics-a-current-and-historical-perspe
### About The Course:
A brief history of the healthcare informatics field emphasizing long recognized key capabilities and the reasons for their slow adoption. An introduction to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability (FHIR) standard and its transformative potential. This is illustrated by an interview with the clinical team developing a FHIR based tool for use in an ICU environment. A survey of the problems and challenges facing healthcare systems around the world and in the US in particular. An introduction of chronic disease and its key role in rising healthcare costs. Alternate care models that show promise of improving healthcare outcomes while lowering cost and their dependency on the use of information technology. The concept of a Learning Healthcare System that continuously improves using informatics to glean new knowledge from actual patient care and feed it back to providers as they take care of future patients. An interview with a team of Emory researchers that are using a FHIR-based tool to help lower the cost of hospital care while improving outcomes. A discussion of electronic medical records, the federal programs to stimulate their adoption and the challenges physicians have in using them. An interview with the lead of the FHIR effort at the major health IT vendor Cerner. A detailed discussion of the rich array of patient-facing informatics tools and approaches used in the past and being increasingly deployed at present. An activity using Microsoft’s Personal Health Record system for patients. A detailed discussion of the complex technical and policy issues surrounding the sharing and exchange of confidential health information. An interview with a Blockchain expert and with an expert on data models for sharing of healthcare information for research
### What You Will Learn:

## Health Informatics: Data and Interoperability Standards
The key standards for representing and sharing healthcare data.
### Link:
https://www.edx.org/course/health-informatics-data-and-interoperability-stand
### About This Course:
Once electronic health records and other clinical systems used in patient care are digital, the focus turns to how this health information can be represented and shared using standards. Developing standards that are both sufficiently comprehensive and also implementable in practice is one of the long-standing health informatics challenges in part because of the complexity of the human body and the resultant complexity of patient care. We discuss data and data sharing (interoperability) standards separately but they are inevitably intertwined since the information being shared using interoperability standards is often represented using data standards.
### What You Will Learn:
* Working familiarity with the major health care data standards
* Awareness of the web-based tools for accessing the data standards
* HL7 as the global health care interoperability standards organization
* HL7 interoperability standards history
* The HL7 interoperability standards that preceded FHIR
* The FHIR interoperability standard
* The SMART on FHIR EHR connected app platform
* Familiarity with web-based tools for learning and utilizing FHIR and SMART on FHIR

## Health Informatics: The Cutting Edge
Some of the key focus areas for health informatics research and development
### Link:
https://www.edx.org/course/health-informatics-the-cutting-edge
### About This Course:
Adopting digital health records and sharing the data they contain is a critical step forward. However, since successful management of chronic disease must involve patients, using informatics tools and systems to engage them is now a major area of focus for academic and industry research and development. Much of our focus so far has been on the care of patients one at a time. Another major area of research and development involves the aggregation of data from large groups of patients to understand population (or public) health issues such as the factors external to traditional medicine that cause disease and that impact on our ability to treat it. Finally, digital health data is increasingly being used for research on methods to deploy predictive analytics to improve the diagnosis and treatment of disease as well as to run hospitals and health systems more cost effectively.
### What You Wll Learn:
